This is "Wall Street Week."
I'm David Westin
bringing you
stories of capitalism.
This week, we take a look at
the Trump administration's
creativity in finding the cash
for that sovereign wealth fund
the president wants so badly.
Plus, national security rubs up
against economic policy,
and the art of the deal
in the saga of TikTok.
And getting the planes
to run on time.
The state of the US
air traffic control system
and rival competing solutions
for how to make it better.
But we start with President
Trump's big tariff announcement.
-My fellow Americans,
this is Liberation Day.
Westin: And what it may mean
for the US economy.
Our special contributor
Larry Summers of Harvard
tells us the story.
-I think that we basically
have a moment
when we're discussing whether
the existing system of
global economic integration,
where products are produced
in supply chains
across multiple countries,
is going to be something
we're going to preserve
with all the efficiencies,
all the benefits to consumers,
all the increase in their
purchasing power
that it has brought,
or whether we're going
to try to turn the clock back
to where it was before
the Second World War.
And if we turn it back,
I think that's going to be
enormously costly
for the United States
and for the world economy.
I think people may not,
just because there's always
a clamor about something,
appreciate just how sweeping
the proposals the United States
has made are.
The United States has
traditionally been
the world's leading advocate
of open markets,
to keep our alliances together,
to help the best
American companies and workers
be able to export to help
American consumers
buy goods at low costs.
We're talking now about
the United States imposing
by far the highest
tariffs of any
reasonable-sized economy
in the world.
We're talking about
the United States having
tariffs that are
well above the level of
the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that
made the depression great.
And markets are processing that
and they're seeing
a big set of problems,
a big set of reductions
in economic activity ahead.
And the stock market only
measures a very small fraction
of the losses to the economy
from policies of this kind.
There are also
big losses to workers,
to consumers, and that
spread more broadly.
So, we're going to make
very important choices
in the weeks ahead.
I hope we make them wisely,
which will involve
backing off of
the policies that have
been announced.
Westin: And that's
what happened on Wednesday,
when President Trump announced
a 90-day suspension
of most of the tariffs, with
the notable exception of China.
You referred to history
a couple times before.
The World War II,
Smoot-Hawley back in 1930.
Does history give us
any guidance
about where we might go?
For example, Richard Nixon,
when he was president, did
take us off the gold standard,
and there was
a fairly abrupt change
in global economics as a result
of what President Nixon did.
Have we had this sort of
abrupt departure
from what has been before
in economic policy before?
-This is a much more
abrupt change
than when Richard Nixon
took us off the gold standard.
Then there were 10% tariffs,
and those were just the--
those were the policy.
Now the 10% tariffs are treated
as some kind of base.
The efforts of the United States
in the aftermath of what
President Nixon did
were to cooperate with
other countries,
not to coerce other countries.
So, I don't know that there
really is a historical precedent
for what's being done now,
and markets are speaking
with incredible clarity.
Sometimes markets are
hard to interpret,
but this is not
one of those times.
Westin: You have handled
your fair share of crises,
both as the Treasury Department
secretary but also in
the White House during
the great financial crisis.
From your experience,
if you were back
in the White House
or the Treasury Department,
what would you be looking at
as perhaps
the next shoe to drop?
What would you be most
concerned about right now?
-I'd be--
I would have one concern
if I was in the White House
or in the Treasury,
and that was my boss, the
president of the United States.
The main shoe that will drop
or will not drop
is the next thing
the president says
and the next order
that he gives.
And so, I would be telling
his political advisers
that this had nothing to do with
what was being said
in other countries.
This had nothing important to do
with business executives'
actions in the United States.
That if the president
was on this course,
there would not be confidence.
And if the president
signaled a willingness
to adjust his course,
there would be confidence.
And so, the sole preoccupation
that I would have
if I were in the government
would be with what
the president was saying.
And frankly, as I've
said before, David,
there are a very limited
number of issues
and has to be
immensely significant
that makes it
the right and moral thing
for a senior official to resign
because he is not comfortable
with the direction
that the president is setting,
and the president is entitled
to have advisers
who believe in his policies
and individuals are entitled
to follow their conscience.
And so, there are moments
when the right thing to do
is for a senior official
to resign.
When Elliot Richardson resigned,
when given what he found to be
an unacceptable order
from Richard Nixon,
that was such an example.
When Cyrus Vance resigned
because he didn't support
what the Carter administration
was doing in Iran,
that was an example.
When a number of officials in
President Clinton's
administration
were not able to support
his welfare reform bill,
they chose to resign.
Frankly, if I were in
an administration that were
pursuing policies
as dangerous as these,
I would be thinking
very carefully about
whether I had the ability
to influence policies
in a positive direction,
or whether the right thing
for me to do was to resign.
Westin: So, Larry, you and I
have talked in the past about
the question whether, in fact,
various people and entities
will absorb
the increased tariffs
so it won't actually, to a large
degree, fall on the consumer.
What do you make of
the arguments that, you know,
producers, intermediaries may
well absorb a lot of the pain?
-I think they're
unquestionably wrong.
Economists have
studied very carefully
the experience of the previous
Trump tariff increases.
For example, they looked
at washing machines
that were tariffed
versus dryers
that were not tariffed.
They used a variety of
different methodologies.
Essentially all the studies
concluded that
prices go up with tariffs.
I've had the opportunity now
to speak with
senior executives at a range
of major retailers.
That is certainly their view.
I suspect when you start
getting earnings calls
and business leaders are asked
will they absorb tariffs,
will they be able to
push tariffs back onto
their suppliers, or do they
expect tariffs
to raise consumer prices,
I suspect they will acknowledge
that the dominant effect
will be on--on consumer prices.
And the important thing for
people to understand is that
this moment is very different
than the previous
Trump tariff moment.
It comes at a moment
when we already have
some inflation psychology.
It comes at a moment
when the economy is
pretty close to
full employment.
And most importantly,
these tariffs are
more than 10 times as large
as the tariffs that were
put in place in 2018,
and therefore there's far less
room for them to be absorbed
in the traditional margin of
distributors or suppliers.
So, I think it's
fundamentally dishonest
to make any claim that these
tariffs are going to do anything
other than be passed on
in the form of higher prices.
Westin: Coming up, President
Trump wants a sovereign
wealth fund of his very own.
But to get there, he's going to
have to come up with
some cold, hard cash.
We suggest where he might
look for it.
This is a story about
creative solutions.
What happens when a country
wants a sovereign wealth fund
but doesn't have
ready cash to put into it?
The Trump administration
is willing to get creative
to answer that question.
And our colleague
Michael McKee brings us
the story.
-We are going to monetize
the asset side
of the US balance sheet
for the American people.
-President Trump's
executive order for a US
sovereign wealth fund
will require the country
to raise trillions of dollars,
and fast.
The biggest sovereign wealth
fund in the world is Norway's,
worth 1.8 trillion.
It's run by Nicolai Tangen.
-We have invested in 9,000
companies around the world.
We own 1.5% of all the equities
in the world.
I think you need money
to set it up.
I don't think it makes sense
to borrow money to set it up.
-It's mostly countries
that run a surplus,
that have excess cash to spend,
that don't need to
deficit finance or debt issue
to finance their deficits.
-Mark Cabana is the head of
US rates strategy
at Bank of America.
-And the US does not meet
any of those categories,
so, it would be
fairly nontraditional
across the countries
who are utilizing
sovereign wealth funds today.
-Former tech investment banker
for Morgan Stanley
Michael Grimes
is tasked with setting up
the new sovereign wealth fund.
One of the administration's
suggestions to raise
the money needed is by
monetizing the country's
balance sheet.
So, what is on
that balance sheet?
-Well, the treasury secretary
has talked about this,
certainly said that they do,
the current administration
does want to try and monetize
the balance sheet to use all
available financial resources.
However,
we struggle to understand
exactly what would want
to be monetized
on the balance sheet.
-As of the fiscal year
ending September 2024,
the US balance sheet shows
total assets of $5.6 trillion
coming from cash, property,
investments, and inventory.
Also on that balance sheet,
8,200 metric tons of gold
valued at about $765 billion.
-So, there is a relationship
between the Treasury and Fed
that has set the price of gold
essentially 9 times lower
than where the market is today.
And there is discussion out
there about the possibility of
remarking gold
to current value,
to then generate
additional resources
that the government
could utilize.
Seems pretty easy
and clean in one respect.
However, we believe it's
going to be a bit more
complicated in practice.
Current law suggests
that Congress
actually sets
the statutory rate on gold.
So, Congress would have to
be the ones who decide
to accept a remarking of gold.
And we are not sure that
Congress would necessarily
want to do that in order to
allow the government
to have more resources that
essentially don't need to be
paid for with deficits or
higher Treasury issuance
that would free up--it would
essentially create money
to be spent in the economy
almost in ways similar to QE.
And in an environment with
still elevated inflation
and some signs that inflation
expectations are ticking up,
we are not so sure
Congress would want to
move in that direction.
Now, if they choose
not to monetize gold
on the government's
balance sheet,
then if you look at what other
assets could be monetized,
they generally take you
mostly to
land, property, and other
natural resources.
-Plus, if you're talking
about remarking gold,
the technical way of getting
that money to the Treasury
goes through
the Federal Reserve.
You raise the risk
of the Fed seeing--
being seen as politicized,
and you raise the risk,
possibly, of inflation.
-Absolutely. It would
essentially impact
the Fed's balance sheet
in very similar ways to how
QE impacts the Fed's
balance sheet.
However, in contrast to QE,
you would have the asset
that's changing,
not be securities holdings
on the asset side of
the Fed's balance sheet,
but you would have it be gold
that is increasing.
And then if gold does increase,
then other liabilities
on the Fed's balance sheet
would naturally need to grow.
Those would presumably be
commercial bank reserves,
cash that commercial banks hold,
or cash in money markets in the
overnight reverse repo facility.
Either way, it essentially
grows the size of the Fed's
balance sheet.
It grows the money supply.
And then that does mean
that there are greater risks
that it could stoke inflation.
It certainly gives
the government more resources
to go out and spend on whatever
it might want to spend on
or to help finance the deficit
if there's lower revenue growth
due to a reduction in taxes.
So, yes, it runs the risk of
being inflationary,
and we doubt that the Fed
would be terribly comfortable
with that,
given where inflation is today
and where some measures
of inflation expectations
are going.
-President Trump
has another idea
to monetize the balance sheet.
He's suggesting
the government can
sell off its federal
buildings and properties,
which fall under property,
plant, and equipment,
coming in at around $1 trillion
on the balance sheet.
-We could see a case
where they might sell
some government buildings
that are not being utilized,
especially with some of
the other changes taking place
in federal employment right now,
but it's hard for us to envision
what else could be monetized
beyond that.
Might they sell land that
the military is using? Possibly.
But presumably the military
is using that for good reason.
Could they sell other natural
resources or treasures,
like the Statue of Liberty?
I hope not,
but that is
a theoretical possibility.
So, we're just not
really certain
what else they would sell,
but if you're not
going to remark gold,
then there are
very few other options,
we think, for them to monetize
the asset side of
the government's balance sheet
outside of maybe
selling some buildings.
-Is there a reason we would
necessarily want to run
a sovereign wealth fund to do
these kind of investments
instead of just doing
the investments, say,
through the
International Development Bank
or something like that?
There have been talk
for years about
an infrastructure bank,
that sort of thing.
-Sure. Or doing them
through Congress,
having Congress
appropriate funds
for these types of purposes.
Why would you utilize a
sovereign wealth fund for that?
Well, presumably because
it gives the individuals
who are overseeing
the sovereign wealth fund
more flexibility as to where
investments can be made.
And presumably,
it would be done in a way
that does not require as much
congressional authorization
or potentially oversight.
So, it's just more degrees
of flexibility, I think,
for those who would be
overseeing that fund.
-Salar Ghahramani is a professor
at Penn State University
who has done some research on
what a US sovereign wealth fund
would mean for the US.
Well, the sovereign
wealth funds we hear about
all have wealth.
They come from
locations where there is
mineral wealth
or something that adds
to the treasury.
The US has a big deficit.
We don't have sovereign wealth
at this point.
-Yeah. It's interesting.
There have been very, very few.
In fact, there may not have been
any sovereign wealth funds
that were not created
by some sort of a surplus.
And as you just noted,
we have a deficit
and we have a national debt
and no, no surplus.
There might be creative
ways to gather assets
and put it into the portfolio
of a sovereign wealth fund.
But again, I would venture out
and underline
that word "creative."
So, it may not be intuitive,
but I think there are ways.
-One major challenge
that stands in the way
of a US sovereign wealth fund is
the issue of the national debt,
which runs $36 trillion deep.
-One of the concerns about
the proposed US
sovereign wealth fund is that
is it the most efficient way
to address the specific reasons
for the creation
of the sovereign wealth fund?
For instance, if the reason is
to be infrastructure spending,
Congress has already allocated
billions of dollars toward--
trillions of dollars, in fact,
toward infrastructure spending.
So, yeah, there is a concern
that creating
a brand-new bureaucracy to
answer whatever the question
might be, whether it's potential
Social Security shortfalls
down the road, whether it's
infrastructure projects,
would it make sense to divert
the attention
from--from paying for
those specific projects
and going through
a brand-new bureaucracy
to address those issues?
-But there might be
some benefits to a potential
US sovereign wealth fund.
-Ideally, if
the long-term interests,
financial interests of
the United States
is the primary concern,
and not so much
driving geopolitical interests,
and that can have
legitimacy, too,
infrastructure projects
potentially, addressing
potential shortcomings of--of
Social Security and so on
could potentially be looked at
as a legitimate
usage of the sovereign
wealth fund.
However, there could also be
the possibility that
the sovereign wealth fund's
primary purpose
is not so much the long-term
financial interests
and the financial outcomes
of the fund itself,
but being in line with
some other national interests,
whether it's related to
foreign policy
or whatever else
the case might be.
-Where could a fund
like that invest?
Would it work to have it
invest in the US,
or would it need to go overseas
to avoid conflicts of interest?
-There are sovereign wealth
funds that are created with
specific legal mandates of
asset allocation strategies
and even the asset classes
in which they can invest.
Norwegian legal mandate,
for instance,
for the Norwegian
sovereign wealth fund,
is as specific as saying
that no more than
5% of the fund's assets can be
invested in asset class X,
and there are also
percentages specifically
designed around
areas of geography.
So, ideally there should be
a legal mandate,
transparently discussed,
that limits--
that puts at least constraints
on what the sovereign
wealth fund can invest in.
Ideally, a good
sovereign wealth fund
would be diversified
across geographies,
across asset classes, across
even external asset managers,
which is something that many
sovereign wealth funds employ.
-The idea of
a sovereign wealth fund
is not new to the 20 US states
that have
sovereign wealth funds,
including Alaska.
-It's a way for Alaskans to
store their nonrenewable
resource, especially
oil, mining, minerals, etc.,
and so, in 1976,
the state legislature sent
to the people of Alaska
a constitutional resolution
to constitutionalize
the concept of a permanent fund
in our Constitution,
and that was successful.
The Permanent Fund
was born in '76.
1980, the Permanent Fund
dividend came into being.
This is all as a result of oil
that was discovered in Alaska
and some really, really
smart people
that had a lot of foresight.
The fear was that we would
spend all of our oil money
and we wouldn't have anything
for future generations.
What the Permanent Fund does
is it captures
the royalties of
oil and minerals
and puts them into a
constitutionally protected fund.
That fund is called a corpus.
It is invested into equities,
private--public equities,
real estate, etc.,
and the idea is to continually
grow the fund so that over time,
we will have--we'll have
a fund that can help
future generations of Alaskans,
at the same time paying out
a dividend every year
to current Alaskans.
About 640,000 Alaskans
will receive
a dividend this coming year.
-Just because it's a good idea
for his state, that doesn't mean
Governor Dunleavy sees
a similar path forward
for the federal
sovereign wealth fund.
-I don't know if it
makes sense to borrow money
to put into the fund,
but I think
what the federal government
can do is something similar
that, you know, what Alaska
has done, and that is
royalties on federal lands,
whether it's oil,
whether it's gas,
possibly timber, mining,
any income that's produced
on federal lands
could actually have some of that
go into a permanent fund
and grow a permanent fund
just like Alaska has.
So, especially when
you're looking at
nonrenewable resources,
oil and gas, it may make sense.
And there is a lot of
federal land.
There are a lot of
offshore leases,
onshore leases potentially.
And so, you know, it is
something to think about.
We're proud of the Permanent
Fund because once again,
we know that we have saved
a considerable amount of money
for future generations.
Westin: Coming up, the strange,
twisted tale of TikTok
and President Trump's version
of the art of the deal,
national security style.
That's next on
"Wall Street Week."
This is a story where
"Let's Make a Deal"
meets national security.
TikTok has been
something of a pinata,
caught between its appeal to
some 170 million Americans
and a US government
that has found it
a national security risk.
The question is whether
President Trump's
dealmaking skills
can reconcile the two.
Richard Haass of Centerview
Partners spent over 20 years
as head of the Council of
Foreign Relations
and has seen his fair share
of wheeling and dealing
over national security.
What is the intersection
between national security
on the one hand
and commercial transactions,
such as TikTok, on the other?
-Well, TikTok's a special one,
in part because of the data
that could be
captured and transferred.
Also the content.
I'm always struck by
the difference between
TikTok China and TikTok America.
Let me just say TikTok America
is the equivalent of drinking
several cans of soda a day and
eating an awful lot of candy,
whereas TikTok China is much
more spinach and educational.
Plus, there's the potential,
obviously, for
political bias and the rest.
So, I think it influences
security both in
the data transfer
way potentially,
as well as in
the content way,
but--and I think it
makes the larger point
that in many cases,
economic transactions
do have a national
security dimension,
whether it's direct or indirect.
Westin: Given that dimension
of national security
in normal
commercial transactions,
where should the line be?
I mean, how far should
the government go
in really interfering
with commerce?
-That's a good question.
It's hard to give you a
rule of thumb that's
in every instance, but
one ought to at least assess the
national security implications.
That's why, for example,
you have CFIUS,
the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States,
that looks at when you have
incoming, say, investment.
Does that give this party
access to something that
could give them,
therefore, data or information
or technologies that
either could give them
a competitive advantage
or even a strategic advantage?
I think that's
a legitimate screen to have.
Export controls are
a second legitimate screen
before we ship
something overseas.
We want to say again, is this
giving someone
a competitive advantage?
Could they take this
technology, which almost
all technology is dual-use,
and use it either for
internal repression,
or could something that's
meant for, say,
a civilian airliner end up
in the cockpit of a, of a
military fighter and so forth?
So, I think the idea of asking
those questions is healthy.
Probably also, David,
in this day and age,
it's not just security,
but against
foreign challenges
because of COVID,
because of natural disasters,
at times we've got
to ask questions.
What do we need to either have
domestically produced,
home shoring,
near shoring, friend shoring,
when we put together
supply chains of
critical materials and so forth.
So, I think, again, we need to
ask, to what degree are we
comfortable leaving ourselves
somewhat vulnerable or open
to the vicissitudes of what
other governments might do
or just simply what
may happen out there?
Westin: The specific
national security concerns
surrounding TikTok range from
the data it collects from
users in the US
to the very heart
of its secret sauce,
its algorithm.
Jennifer Huddleston
is a senior fellow
of tech policy
at the Cato Institute.
-When we look at
some of the concerns
around the TikTok algorithm,
for example,
is this actually about TikTok
or actually about
TikTok's ties to China,
or is this about the way
that we see young people
using social media
more generally
that may be causing
some discomfort
from older generations?
What the national security
interest is
is actually a bit of a debate.
One of the things
that has been pointed to
are questions around the data,
and particularly how it relates
to a Chinese
national security law,
and concerns that in a way
that the Chinese government
could lean on TikTok's
parent company,
that could lean on
TikTok in Singapore,
that could lean on TikTok US,
that could force the data
on the American users
to be given to
the Chinese Communist Party.
But we've also heard
concerns expressed
more around
the TikTok algorithm,
or around the specific speech
on TikTok
that some policymakers are
considering to be propaganda.
And the question here, then,
that is raised
is how do we balance
potential concerns about
national security, particularly
related to the data elements,
with concerns around
free speech?
Because it's important to
remember that not only are we
talking about TikTok
and TikTok's expression rights,
we're talking about
the expression rights
of the millions of
American users.
Westin: If those are
the potential
national security interests,
the data and the algorithm,
can we in the United States
protect those
national security interests
if ByteDance still has any
control, any ownership at all
of the algorithm or the data?
-This has been
one of the important
elements of the debate.
Are there less restrictive means
that could address the potential
national security concerns
while not having as significant
of an impact on the speech,
particularly of the American
users of this platform?
So, some of the things that
have been proposed include
things like banning TikTok
from government devices.
This is something
we've seen done at both
a state and federal level
that has largely been upheld
to ensure that that data,
perhaps, is more secure.
There's also been
conversations around
what was called Project Texas,
where TikTok offered
to localize the American data
on Oracle servers in Texas
and allow the US government
additional oversight
over that data.
The other question about
the data is is this data
actually any--is this
a particular risk
when it comes to TikTok's data?
Much of this data
is already available
on the market from data brokers.
We've also seen that
the Chinese have engaged in
numerous hacks to obtain
American data.
So, is the risk of TikTok
any bigger than
the data privacy or
data security risk
out there more generally?
And is this something that,
instead of talking about TikTok,
we should be talking about
data security
and data privacy more broadly?
Westin: The focus is very much
on the administration of
President Trump right now,
but the statute
came from Congress.
Does the--does
the congressional statute
have a threshold ownership
that if you get it down to
a certain number,
a certain percentage,
then it's OK?
-So, there are percentages
in the congressional statute,
but I think what's more
interesting is this question of
what does a qualified
divestiture look like,
because the law from Congress
is very vague
on what would actually
have to be divested.
Are we talking about
TikTok's brand?
Are we talking
about TikTok's algorithm?
Are we talking about
the data itself?
Because this national
security concern
has also been rather vague.
Westin: Does the president have
the ability to extend 75 days?
The statute had
an initial extension,
but I don't remember
a second extension.
-So, this has been
a really good question,
because the statute had
a 90-day extension.
There were also actions from
the Department of Justice
in a letter sent to
some of the American companies
that could have been
subject to the penalties
that seems to have
been around the potential
non-enforcement of those
penalties, ensuring that
the app was still available
to the Americans
who have used it for expression.
But as you mentioned,
we've seen this done
by executive order
and executive order,
kind of like hitting the snooze
button again and again,
which doesn't actually get to
that underlying question
and those underlying issues that
are so important to this debate.
Regardless of what happens
to TikTok,
at the heart of this law
is the question of
how do we balance potential
national security concerns
with the speech rights of
millions of Americans,
particularly on a popular
social media app,
but more generally, what
sort of authority do we allow
the executive to have
to intervene
into the app store market,
to intervene, potentially,
into the speech rights of
millions of Americans?
Even if this continues to be
done by executive order,
even if TikTok lives
to see the day,
we haven't necessarily settled
that important debate.
-There is, in principle, a deal.
And clearly, by the way,
President Trump wants a deal
for whatever set of reasons.
I tend not to be in the business
of ascribing motives,
but he is clearly
anxious to have a deal.
He keeps kicking
down the stream, down the road,
the, the, the deadline here.
But I would just say
whatever the details are
at the end of the day,
in terms of data and content,
I would also love to see
reciprocity, though,
if we--if we do end up
with control over
both data and content, then
we--then we don't need it,
then essentially, we set up
a parallel situation with China.
Westin: Though everyone
is focused on
the effect of the ban on TikTok,
the statute itself
is directed not at TikTok
but at US companies
including access
to the social media site
over their products.
-I think it's important
to also remember
when we're talking about
this particular law,
that the burden of the law
actually falls on
American companies.
The law says that
TikTok must divest
from its parent company,
ByteDance,
or it otherwise bans
the distribution, maintenance,
or updating of the app.
That means those that are
actually facing penalties
are not TikTok itself, but are
companies like Apple and Google
who, if they continued to host
the app, would be the ones
that would potentially be
facing penalties that have
up to a 5-year
statute of limitations
that could extend beyond this
current administration.
Westin: And the TikTok case
raises some big questions about
reciprocity, both in
the way that China treats
US social media companies
and in what other countries
might do to regulate
US companies.
-It's not like we American
social media companies
have access to China in terms of
asking them to transfer data
or allowing us
to control content.
So, this is, you know,
incredibly one-sided.
Westin: You raise
the reciprocity issue
going back and forth between
the US and China.
Are we opening up the door
potentially to other countries
saying, "Wait a second.
We don't want you to own
the data, the algorithm, when
you're coming into our country"?
-Quite possibly, and I think
the fact that the United States
has been adopting a more
nationalist position,
a more unilateralist
position on tariffs
and many other
aspects of policy,
an America First approach,
the Europeans clearly
do not feel special,
to say the least.
So, yes, I think
we have to expect
that we're going to move
into a world now--
we're moving towards
a world where
alliances and partnerships
count--count for less,
and others are going to
treat us more at arm's length
and set up the kind of rules
vis-a-vis the United States
that we're increasingly
setting up vis-a-vis them.
Westin: Coming up, we've all
been caught in those
maddening flight delays.
Is there any way
we can save all of us
some of that
time and aggravation?
We bring you several
possible alternatives
next on "Wall Street Week."
This is a story about
kicking the can down the road.
Big changes in big systems
are never easy.
And when it comes to the way
we manage our airspace,
one thing is certain--
the system is under strain
and has
long needed an overhaul.
But for the past 30 years,
it has been easier
to kick that can down the road.
-Global tech outages linked to
Microsoft and CrowdStrike
causing widespread
business disruptions.
-Thousands of flights being
delayed or canceled.
-I mean, this is
an industry that has had
a lot of post-COVID issues
and a lot of issues with
investing into
this exact type
of infrastructure.
Westin: In 2024, airlines
reported 437 tarmac delays
of more than 3 hours
on domestic flights,
up from 289 in 2023.
Of all flights last year,
more than 5% were delayed
because of national
aviation system issues.
Safety, of course, is the top
priority in regulating flights,
and sadly this year,
airline safety
has been in the news
too often.
-A passenger plane
has collided
with a military helicopter
mid-air in Washington, DC.
-We know that 64
were on that
American Airlines
commercial flight
and 3 were on that US Army
Black Hawk helicopter.
Westin: But despite
some recent incidents,
flying within the United States
is remarkably safe.
Elaine Chao was
the transportation secretary
under President Trump
during his first term.
-I think it's important for
people to know that we have
literally the safest system
in the world,
and that the United States
is still considered
basically the gold standard.
But clearly, technology changes,
and maintenance and repairs
need to keep up.
Westin: Edward Bolen agrees
that the system is safe,
but that we need to make
some investments.
He's the head of
the association representing
the private business side
of the aviation industry.
-We know definitively that it is
the safest, the most efficient,
the largest,
and the most diverse
air transportation system
in the world by a lot.
But we need to be investing in
the people, the facilities,
and the equipment to make sure
that we are able to
continue to respond
in a dynamic way.
Westin: Federal air traffic
control in the US began in 1941,
and computer technology was
added to radars in the 1960s
thanks to IBM.
In February 1982,
the FAA released its first
comprehensive plan for
improving ATC services.
This system has been
in place for some time now.
Was it built for this
much load and how much
more load is there going
to be in the future?
-Well, I think the load is
going to continue because
air travel
has become democratized
ever since 1978 with
the deregulatory aspects of
air traffic, passenger traffic.
And so, it's almost as easy
to go on an airplane
as it would be to,
let's say, a bus.
And so, more and more people
are going.
And now we have
over a billion passengers,
and they're accessing the system
that clearly was not prepared
for even a fraction
of the current volume.
Westin: According to the FAA's
preliminary data,
there were 16.8 million flights
in the nation's airspace
in 2024,
an increase of about
500,000 from 2023.
-It's making air travel
much more difficult
for the consumer.
How many of us can say
within a month
that we have never been
caught in a delay
or some kind of cancellation?
And this is despite
the best efforts
of air traffic controllers
and of airlines
who want to fly frequently
so that they can provide
a steady service
to their passengers.
Westin: It's more than
just the inconvenience
of all those delays.
The government has taken
a hard look
at the existing air traffic
control system
and found it
to be unsustainable.
-FAA did this risk assessment
to understand
of the existing systems,
which ones are unsustainable,
which ones might be
potentially unsustainable
and need investments
to modernize them?
Many of these systems are aging
and face
longstanding challenges...
Westin: Heather Krause is
the managing director of
physical infrastructure
at the GAO,
which produced a report
on the overall state
of the air traffic control
system in the United States.
In March, she testified before
Congress about its findings.
-So, around 17
we found to be
somewhat concerning in terms of
the timelines that they have
as well as 4 of those systems
not having baselines,
so, not knowing when those
systems will be delivered.
So, important that
FAA focuses on
what are the most
critical systems,
how are they going to
mitigate risks in the meantime
as they are working through
the modernization efforts
and then delivering on those
modernization plans?
Westin: Washington
has been talking about
updating the system
for at least 40 years.
It's commonly referred to
as NextGen,
short for Next Generation.
-So, in terms of NextGen,
it's already being deployed
in the national airspace system,
and so, the ways that
it's improving operations
is through various phases of
flight and really through
kind of some key areas.
So, improvements
in communications.
So, for example, communications
between pilots and controllers
and digitizing some of
those communications.
Navigation improvements to--
to create more efficient routes
for airplanes to travel from
their arrival to destination,
which leads to
efficiency benefits
as well as fuel savings.
There's things--also automation,
so there's new automation tools
being added to the system
to support
the air traffic controllers'
management, again,
of the efficient
and safe operation
of the national airspace system
as well as surveillance.
So, having better situational
awareness and ability
to more accurately track
where aircrafts are at.
All of those efforts
kind of come together
and the real goal of NextGen
is to kind of get
to what's called
trajectory-based operations.
What that is, is really
additional data and tools
for the controllers to better
manage and sequence flights
from arrival to departure.
So, again, controllers,
you know, they're, they're
managing flights with, you know,
altitude, longitude,
and latitude,
and these tools
offer the additional
kind of--considering time
as another element of
managing the flight.
So, controllers would have
an ability to know
where and at what time aircraft
are at key points in a route
taking into consideration
conditions and other things
even before
an aircraft takes off.
Westin: The long runway
for modernizing our
air traffic control system
is a real problem
as technology continues
to evolve.
-By the time that
the air traffic controllers
can get a new piece
of equipment,
it's about 7 or 8 years old.
It's not as modern
as it should be.
It took forever for
the air traffic control system
to have a GPS system.
Westin: If everyone agrees that
the air traffic control system
needs to move to
the next generation,
why has it taken 4 decades
to get to where we need to be?
First of all, it is complex
and requires great care to
make sure we get it right.
-The systems themselves
have to be certified,
and that means they have to
have a degree of redundancy
and resilience that is different
than what you would see in a lot
of off-the-shelf technologies.
It's got to be integrated.
It's got to be certified.
So, that's part of it.
Westin: That's part of it,
but far from the only part.
What about the controllers
who run the system?
There's general consensus
about their being
outstanding professionals.
-It's a tribute to
the men and women
of the air traffic control
that they can keep
the system kind of
safe and maintained
with their expertise.
-Our air traffic controllers
are outstanding.
They go through a very rigorous
training process,
and it takes years.
Westin: But as good as
the controllers are,
we need more of them.
There were fewer air traffic
controllers in the United States
in 2024 than in 2011.
-We need to make sure that
we are getting enough
that are being put into place.
Currently, we're not where
we need to be.
We're anywhere from 20% to 25%
behind where
we would like to be.
-Some people are
saying we should
increase the age of
air traffic controllers.
Right now, they're
maxed out at 56 years old.
You know, at 56 these days,
we're in much better health
than what we used to be
a generation ago.
And so, for those that
want to work beyond 56,
we should be able to allow them
to have that option,
and currently they don't.
Westin: Even more than the need
for more air traffic controllers
is the need to expedite
the procurement process
for getting them
the equipment that they need
and get it to them faster.
-The procurement is challenging.
We--we get money that needs to
be spent on an annual basis.
We'd like to see that
be more multiyear
so that we can have
more money up front
and be able to carry that
through in a multiyear process.
Westin: Secretary Chao agrees
that it takes far too long
to get the latest equipment
purchased and deployed,
but that it's more than just
streamlining things.
The problem may be in the very
structure of the system.
-In 2017, there was an effort
under the first Trump
administration to reorganize
the structure of
the air traffic control.
And basically, it would take
the air traffic control.
It's not privatizing it
because it's being put into
a nonprofit organization,
but rather,
I call it liberating the FAA
and the air traffic control,
basically liberating
the air traffic control
from FA--and more,
even more succinctly,
the federal government,
so that air traffic control,
like many others structured
like this around the world,
would be their own entity.
They would have their own
nonprofit status,
they would have their own
board of directors,
but more importantly, they would
use their own
funding of resources
and be able to use it
for long-term planning.
Westin: As you look around
the world, has anyone done this?
Can we go to school
on any other country
and the way
they've handled this?
-Well, Canada is
a primary example.
Great Britain, Australia.
There are many other countries
who have taken
air traffic control out of
the government process
and put it separately in
its own nonprofit organization.
And by doing that,
it allows this nonprofit
air traffic control system
to plan ahead,
have control over
100% of its budget,
and be able to purchase
equipment at a very timely rate
and very efficiently as well.
Westin: Not everyone agrees
with Secretary Chao about
splitting the safety
responsibilities
from the day-to-day operations
and taking the latter out of
the government altogether.
-What we want to do is make sure
the United States stays
the world leader.
We can do that by looking
at what they're doing in
other countries and what has
candidly not worked well.
So, when we look at countries
around the world like Canada,
the United Kingdom,
Australia, New Zealand
that have privatized their
air traffic control system,
we see a number of challenges
in terms of
their air traffic controllers,
their technology, their delays,
and most importantly,
safety issues.
Westin: Whatever the changes,
no one seems to doubt
that they need to come,
and need to come
sooner rather than later,
for the sake of
the airline business,
the convenience of
all of us flying,
and ultimately to make sure the
US maintains its safety record.
-It is key that
all of the different
parts of the aviation system
have really come together
in sending a message
to Capitol Hill
about what we can do to advance
our air transportation system.
It's not enough to be
the safest
and the most efficient,
the largest and the most diverse
in the world.
-It is still safe to fly.
That said,
continued reliance
on aging systems
does diminish
the margin of safety
and adds additional stress to
the national airspace system,
which is really why it's
important that FAA
improve the management
and oversight
of its modernization efforts.
Next, we ask Richard Haass
about the winners and losers
so far
under President Trump's
approach to foreign policy.
It's not just the world of
trade and economics
President Trump has
quickly overturned.
His approach to foreign policy
is also different
from what we've seen
in the past.
We asked Ambassador
Richard Haass for his views
on which countries
stand to benefit
and which may suffer.
-Trump 2.0 is very different
than Trump 1.0.
Yes, they're still American
First, but there's, I would say,
in some ways less isolationism,
much more assertive,
particularly in
the Western Hemisphere.
We're seeing that.
All the talk about Panama,
Canada, Mexico,
Greenland, what have you.
We didn't see that during
the first Trump administration,
during the campaign.
Greater unilateralism.
The--the--the tariffs
in particular.
Even more of a tilt
in some ways towards Russia.
So, who's gaining?
One is Russia.
We've essentially re-embrace--
reintegrated Russia
rather unconditionally.
We'll have to see where it goes.
But I think if you're
sitting in the Kremlin,
you've got a sense that
the direction of economic
sanctions is probably
going down and Russia is going
to have more opportunities.
We'll see how the Ukraine
war policy plays out.
But clearly,
Russia is a beneficiary.
Second country is China.
In part--less what we've
done for China directly,
David, more because of
what we've done in the rest of
the world, for example,
the--the gutting of the Agency
for International Development.
That has clearly created
spaces where China can act.
All the tariffs.
The idea that countries
that have been heavily involved
with us economically
in some ways are finding
themselves vulnerable.
Well, a lot of countries
out there, particularly
in the Asia Pacific, my guess is
they're going to want
to diversify
their economic portfolios.
Who's a natural beneficiary
of that will be China.
That China will again have
certain opportunities
to substitute for
the United States
that--that it doesn't have now.
So, those are two countries
that have benefited.
Probably Israel's a third in
the sense that the United States
has taken a pretty
hands-off approach,
unlike some of the pressures
the Biden administration
put on Israel, say, in their
conduct of the Gaza conflict.
This administration is
pulling back much more.
It's giving Israel a pretty free
hand in the West Bank.
They rescinded the sanctions
against settlers and so forth.
So, I think--and probably
more broadly,
authoritarian countries.
You see it with Turkey,
just to name one. Hungary.
Some of the things going on.
I wouldn't call Israel
an authoritarian country,
it's still a democratic country,
but it's more illiberal
than it was.
The arrows are going
in the wrong direction.
And the United States,
both by the behavior
this administration is modeling
and by what it's not saying.
The lack of criticisms.
Some of the Gulf countries,
the Saudis and others,
I think they're looking at
this and they feel much more
comfortable having
a United States that's not
judgmental or critical about
their domestic
political practices.
Westin: Some might say that
with respect to
Russia and China,
there have been various
economic efforts made
to curtail their activities,
discourage them.
Not clear that they succeeded.
If you take them off,
if you reserve--reverse that,
does it likely lead to
more assertiveness
by President Putin,
by President Xi?
-Well, I think President Putin
has made it clear in his
rejection of the ceasefire
proposals for Ukraine
that he's not interested
in that.
I think he's very interested,
though, to see
whether we continue US military
and intelligence support
for Ukraine, say,
beyond the summer.
So far, he hasn't had
to pay a price
for the overtures coming from
this administration,
so, if you don't
have to pay a price
and windows and doors
are being opened,
you tend to--to walk
through them.
China we've been quite
confrontational economically,
both with tariffs--
we've expanded
the entities list
on export controls--
but with TikTok, there's been
some positive signals.
And my--my sense is that
that's probably
the least--what's the word--
disclosed foreign policy
of this administration.
So, I think, you know,
when you and I
have conversations in
3 or 6 or 9 months,
we'll have a much better sense
of where we're going with China,
but the president, President
Trump, has talked repeatedly
about his desire to meet with
his counterpart,
with Xi Jinping, and to have
a deal with China.
What we just don't know are
the contours of the deal.
Westin: Just looking at the
surface of it, Europe would not
seem to be a big winner
under President Trump 2.0.
-No, they're
a loser economically
because of the tariffs.
In general, our allies, who are
our principal trading partners,
are--are--are losers there.
Europe also finds its security
much more in question.
In the long run, though,
there could be some positives
that Europe is going to
have to become
a little bit more
self-sufficient.
They're going to have to
develop a
defense-industrial base
much more than they have.
If they do become more
self-sufficient militarily,
they'll also
have a greater degree of
influence and control over
their--their own future.
The problem is the transition,
and can they stand up to
Russian pressure in, say,
the decade it would take
if they do determine
they want to become
a stronger, more unified place?
And indeed,
that's a big question.
Europe is not really Europe
when it comes to
acting in the strategic sense.
It's much more France and
Germany and Britain and Italy.
One of the big questions
about Europe is whether
it will actually move
in the direction of
more collective effort.
Westin: Closer to home in
the United States, at least,
what about Canada and Mexico?
I mean,
there was a time I thought
it was awfully difficult
to get the Canadians
to get angry with you,
but it seems like we've
managed that in a short time.
-Yes. You're probably--
an angry Canadian used to be
something of an oxymoron.
We've--we've changed that.
Indeed, Mark Carney,
currently the prime minister,
the successor to Justin Trudeau,
is well on his way,
I would think,
to getting elected as
prime minister.
The--the polls have moved,
what, 25%, 30%?
And if he does get elected,
he will literally owe
most of it to--to Donald Trump.
So, that's--that's
a real change.
And I think for Canadians,
this has been
a shocking development.
Uh, let me make
a larger point, though.
Mexico also,
it's been difficult,
but one of the--
the United States has
two great strategic advantages.
One is more generally
our partners and allies.
They're a real force multiplier.
When we face a regional or
global challenge,
we have this pool of partners
we can call upon.
Now much less so.
We have drawn down, if you will,
the goodwill--goodwill there,
and the automaticity of that
is much less.
Because we're
not there for them,
they can't expect us
to--to be there for us.
And then secondly, one of
our strategic advantages
is to our north and our south.
For the last, what, 80 years,
we have had these countries
we had pretty good
relations with.
And it meant that
unlike most countries,
we didn't have to, say,
deploy forces at our borders
and worry about
immediate threats
to us in our neighborhood.
Well, we're doing our best
to change that.
And in some ways, we're
undermining what's been this
great geographic,
strategic advantage,
and I'm not saying we have to--
we're going to face
threats from either country.
The danger is that
the partnerships
do not do nearly as much for us.
So, it worries me
that in some ways,
we're diluting some of
the structural advantages
of American foreign policy
that we've had to our north
and our south
and that we've had globally
with this pool of partners.
Westin: Richard, talk about
the globe more generally.
You mentioned the USAID, Agency
for International Development,
and the curtailing of that
and not eliminating that.
And we're seeing it play out,
even as we speak,
over in Myanmar with the
disaster they've had over there
and our inability, it appears,
to really respond to that.
What price might we be paying
with some of the least fortunate
countries around the world?
-A couple of things.
One is the humanitarian part.
The United States
has traditionally stood
for something more than
cold self-interest.
We potentially pay a health
price in the sense that
diseases will break out
in some of these countries,
and as we learned
the hard way in COVID,
just because something breaks
out in Wuhan or somewhere else
doesn't mean it stays there.
These oceans on either side
of us are not moats,
and germs can travel.
Potentially, as we learned
with 9/11,
countries that aren't strong,
that can't control what goes on
within their own borders,
potentially become
safe havens for terrorists.
And as we learned, again,
on 9/11,
terrorists increasingly
have global reach,
so, we put our security at risk.
If these countries
don't succeed, we lose
economic opportunities
for investment, for trade.
If they don't succeed, it
increases migration pressures.
And one of the things
we've learned the hard way
is we want to have
much more control
over who comes into
this country.
So, for lots of reasons,
from the humanitarian
to the economic
to the strategic,
I really think it's shortsighted
to pull back the aid,
and by the way, it was a very
small amount of our budget.
It was a rounding error
in some ways.
And guess who's
going to benefit?
It's not just going to be
these losses,
but China will bene--China
will be one of the countries
that will be able to step in,
and it will be able
to cultivate goodwill
and have greater access
and so forth.
And again, it's hard for me
to see in the long run
how's--how is that
in the US interest?
That does it for us
here at "Wall Street Week."
I'm David Westin.
This is Bloomberg.
See you next week for more
stories of capitalism.
